Deep Learning Assignment
Detection of powerlines in aerial images acquired from an UAV:

 

 

Condition assessment of power lines is one of the critical components of maintenance. In the current scenario, condition assessment of power lines is carried out manually. Manual inspection is carried out using foot patrol. Inspection of power lines through foot patrol is labour intensive, costly and requires experienced staff. The cost increases linearly with the length of power lines to be inspected.  

Advancements in Drone Technology as a remote sensing platform  and the use of AI in remote sensing applications provides interesting  options for solutions in Power sector. Detection of power lines is one of the interesting applications.  Automated detection of powerlines is a necessary perquisite for advanced systems such as autonomous navigation for inspection of powerlines, Automated inspection of powerlines etc.  In this assignment we build a Deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of Powerlines in Aerial imagery of Powerlines acquired from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
